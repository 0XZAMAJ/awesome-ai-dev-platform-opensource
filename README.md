## üåü Features

  - **End-to-End AI Development Lifecycle**: From data crawling, labeling, training, real-time demos, to deployment.
  - **Supports a Diversity of AI Models and a wide range of data formats**: The platform is highly versatile and supports a wide range of model types, including: CV, ASR, NLP, LLM, Generative AI.
  - **Multi-AI Agent Infrastructure**: Build AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals. These agents work together seamlessly to automate complex workflows, enabling businesses to streamline operations with efficiency and flexibility.
  - **Flexibly Customizable**: AIxBlock allows users to tailor workflows and features to meet their unique requirements.
  - **Decentralized Marketplaces**:
  - Globally distributed, high-end, and on-demand GPU resources.
  - Diverse, high-quality decentralized datasets (*coming soon*).
  -     This Decentralized Dataset Pool is A rich collection of data types, including but not limited to:
              - Thousands of real-world call center audio datasets in multiple languages and accents across various domains and industries (redacted for PII and PHI).
              - Doctor-patient conversations in English (redacted for sensitive information).
              - Real-world medical dictation audio in English.
              - Real-world medical datasets in DICOM format.
              - Real-world utterances in multiple languages.
              - Hundreds of thousands of real-world facial recognition datasets representing multiple ethnicities, all collected with consent forms.
              - Many other unique and high-quality datasets.
              - The pool is continuously enriched by contributions from new contributors globally.
  - Decentralized labelers from over 100 countries.
  - Decentralized pre-trained models for auto-labeling, fine-tuning, and deployment.
  - - **Training DDP (Distributed Data Parallel)**: One of the core technology backbones of AIxBlock is **Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)** training. This allows models, including large language models (LLMs), to be trained across multiple nodes, significantly accelerating the training process and reducing computation bottlenecks. As of now, we support both Pytorch and Tensorflow DDP.
- **Instant Self-Hosting**: Deploy on-premise in minutes with zero complex configurations.
- **Monetization Opportunities**: Monetize your models, AI agents or idle compute resources with just a few clicks through our integrated marketplaces.
