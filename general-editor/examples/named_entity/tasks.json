mortgage ive looked on the website and i i know about the maximum mortgage\n\nnagent says: okay so what sort what what are you looking at in terms of a a figure of an amount\n\nncustomer says: im looking at ninety thousand pounds i i just dont understand why the interest on that is so high\n\nnagent says: okay well i can certainly look into that for you frank can i just ask how long you would like a fixed interest rate for what would be suitable for you would you say\n\nncustomer says: a fifteen year term will be preferable for me\n\nnagent says: yeah okay brilliant have you already chosen obviously you said that you had a look on online have you already chosen a a suitable mortgage type\n\nncustomer says: yeah the product was called peaceful living\n\nnagent says: ah right okay so im just having a look on my system here the sort of interest rate for the peaceful living mortgage account type is nought point seven two percent\n\nncustomer says: okay is is there any way i can get some kind of discount\n\nnagent says: well that figure that ive just given to you was the percentage that we accumulated without a members discount now obviously you have an account with us here at the bank so the figure i just gave you doesnt take that into consideration actually frank\n\nncustomer says: okay what what is what is the discount\n\nnagent says: so we were looking at nought poi nought point seventytwo as an interest rate based on the fact that you werent a member but the fact that you are a valued customer of our bank that would actually give you a discount of nought point six percent\n\nncustomer says: okay with this information were discussing right now is is there any chance that i could receive that in an email\n\nnagent says: well what i would advise just so that you can get a little a little bit more indepth detail is that you go onto our website theres so much information there frank that you can have a good old browse and and get you know answers to frequently asked questions there on our notice board\n\nncustomer says: right i did try that option and it didnt seem to work for me is there is there another way i can\n\nnagent says: yeah of course

frank before i do send that information over i just wanna check the email address that i have on file for you frank is frank dot g at gmail dot com\n\nncustomer says: yes yes yeah thats my email address yeah\n\nnagent says: is that right ah perfect now what i will say is sometimes our emails for some reason they dont always go straight into your current inbox folder so i would suggest that you just check your spam folder just in case you know that email makes its way to there instead i will be sending that out shortly ho within the next sort of five minutes so look out for that for me frank and then obviously we ca we can take it from there\n\nncustomer says: oh thats great yeah i i will do that ill check this before the stuff goes in there and looking their by accident wasnt it so

evening goodbye\n\nncustomer says: ok and you bye\n\nnagent says: hello my name is lynette and thank you so much for calling us here at bartell drugs how may i help you today\n\nncustomer says: yes well mostly the the the symptoms ive been having is soreness and like pain in the lower part of my leg\n\nncustomer says: well ive been having the this pain and soreness for a couple of days now it usually starts in the morning and just like fades out throughout the day but its been on and off on and off\n\nncustomer says: well actually i personally have high cholesterol and in my family i do have a couple of family members that have been through heart disease before so yeah id say yeah\n\nnagent says: okay thank you so much for that information yet okay so then im typing that into my system here and what im finding is actually i can recommend to you a couple of options so one would be muro one hundred and twentyeight eye drops and then another another option would be\n\nnagent says: sure thing yes so the neuro eye drops actually can be taken daily for extended treatment for your soreness issue and then these xyzal is to be taken just as needed whenever youre symptoms flareup\n\nnagent says: oh yes so yes most drugs are definitely safe they just have you know one or two side effects once in a while but it doesnt affect everybody so they just might occur so for example with the muro drops some people have experience some headaches with that once in a while and then it for the xyzal sometimes people might have a little bit of stomach pain but again its not for not everybody has some side effects so what i would just recommend for you is just to consult with your doctor if your symptoms dont diminish after taking the medication\n\nnagent says: yes youre welcome and a also wanted to just let you know that you shouldnt take the the daily medication then euro drops for longer than three weeks okay\n\nnagent says: oh yes yes so i know you mentioned the soreness in your leg so a lot of people have found that just using like a heating pad on their leg helps them with that or maybe massaging your leg and then some people have found even just eating less meat helps those symptoms and helps those the soreness go away as well\n\nnagent says: ohh yes we actually do so several different types of heating pads and many different sizes so yeah i would recommend that you come down to our pharmacy to look at them to see what size would be best for you\n\nnagent says: yes were open everyday from sixam to tenpm\n\nnagent says: yes yes you can purchase them online infact yes so our email im sorry our website address is w w w bartell drugs dot com\n\nnagent says: yes yes when you navigate to our home page we actually have a dedicated coupons tab on the upper left hand corner so you can find our weekly coupons and discounts there"
