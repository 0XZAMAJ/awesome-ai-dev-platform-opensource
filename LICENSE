1. Acceptance
By using the source code, you agree to all the terms and conditions below.

2. Copyright License
The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software, subject to the limitations below.

3. Limitations
Internal Use: You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
Non-Commercial Distribution: You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
Notices: You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensorâ€™s trademarks is subject to applicable law.
4. Contribution and Rewards
Unlike traditional Web2 open-source contributions, all contributions to this repository are recorded on-chain and tracked transparently. See our README.md for full details on contribution incentives.

We allocate 15% of our total token supply for open-source contributors.
Contributors will receive a portion of this allocation on a monthly basis based on their recorded contributions.
The mechanism for contribution evaluation, tracking, and token distribution is detailed in our README.md file.
By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be governed by this license and are eligible for token-based rewards as per our open-source incentive model.
5. Patents
The licensor grants you a license under any patent claims they can license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and have imported the software, subject to the limitations and conditions in this license. This license does not cover any patent claims that you cause to be infringed by modifications or additions to the software. If you or your company make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to the infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately.

6. Notices
Distribution: You must ensure that anyone who receives a copy of any part of the software from you also receives a copy of these terms.
Modifications: If you modify the software, you must include a prominent notice in any modified copies stating that you have modified the software.
7. No Other Rights
These terms do not imply any licenses other than those expressly granted herein.

8. Termination
If you use the software in violation of these terms, such use is not licensed, and your license will automatically terminate. If the licensor notifies you of your violation and you cease all violations within 30 days, your license will be reinstated retroactively. However, if you violate these terms after such reinstatement, any additional violation will cause your license to terminate automatically and permanently.

9. No Liability
As far as the law allows, the software comes "as is," without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.
