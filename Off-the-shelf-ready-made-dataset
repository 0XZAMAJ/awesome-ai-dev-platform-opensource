This folder contains a collection of our publicly shareable off-the-shelf (OTS) datasets for AI training. These datasets are rare, high-quality, and have been meticulously collected and labeled by our in-house data team, supported by a global workforce of over 100,000 freelancers across various countries.

Previously part of our private, premium data assets—some of which have been sold for millions of dollars—these datasets are now being released as a gift to the open-source AI community.

We believe in democratizing access to world-class training data. If you find these resources helpful and want to support us in releasing even more, please consider giving us a ⭐ on GitHub and following us on Hugging Face. Your encouragement keeps us going!

Thank you for being part of this mission.
