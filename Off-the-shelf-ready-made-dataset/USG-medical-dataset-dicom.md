This dataset contains hundreds of ultrasound (USG) cases collected from hundreds of unique patients, representing a wide spectrum of real-world clinical scenarios. Each case is stored in DICOM format, preserving full-resolution imaging data along with essential metadata for medical research and diagnostic model development.

🏥 Data Type: Ultrasound images across various anatomical regions and clinical indications.

📁 Format: Standard DICOM files with embedded metadata.

👥 Patients: Diverse set of patients, covering multiple age groups and both genders.

📊 Use Cases: Suitable for medical imaging research, AI diagnostic model training, anomaly detection, and clinical decision support development.
