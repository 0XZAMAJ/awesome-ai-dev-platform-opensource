Please before you request an access, give us a star on our github account and a follow on Hugging face, it means a lot to us ;) This dataset contains hundreds of short, raw video recordings of damaged cars, captured in the USA and various Asian countries. All footage was originally recorded by our data collection teamâ€”none of the videos were scraped or sourced from the internet.

These videos were part of our premium internal dataset, previously used for commercial purposes in the automotive and insurance sectors. They are now being shared publicly for the first time.

This dataset is ideal for training AI models to detect, localize, and classify vehicle damage, and is highly valuable for applications in automotive diagnostics, insurance claim automation, damage assessment, and related fields.
