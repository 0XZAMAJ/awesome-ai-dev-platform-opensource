● Simulation

○ Positioned the same as Radiotherapy Head Neck

■ Thermoplastic mask, head rest, neutral neck, aligned through

midline, positioned on flat top radiotherapy couch

● Imaging parameters

○ 1.5T

○ Axial post-contrast eg. Gd (gadolinium, or equivalent), T1w 3D (T1
weighted)

○ Acquired in transverse plane ie. on-axis axially.

● Craniocaudal borders:

○ Inclusive of top of cranium down to at least C2 vertebrae

● Slice thickness

○ Radiosurgery brain can be 1mm; Non-stereotactic up to 3mm. 50/50 split on the slice thickness

● WHO Grade 1-4.

○ Disease locally confined to one hemisphere in one part of brain
(infra/supratentorial); meninges; invading/encroaching on ventricular
system
