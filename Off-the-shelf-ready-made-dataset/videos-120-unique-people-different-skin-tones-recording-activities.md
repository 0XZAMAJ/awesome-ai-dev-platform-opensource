This dataset is provided by AIxBlock and features 40 sets, each containing 120 unique individuals with diverse skin tones. Each set includes multiple participants performing a variety of activities across different backgrounds. All videos were recorded using smartphones following a strict guidelineâ€”none of the footage was sourced from the internet.

These videos are designed for training computer vision (CV) models to recognize human activities and movement across a range of environments and skin tones. Previously a private and premium resource, we are now open-sourcing this dataset as part of our mission to build a decentralized dataset pool for AI developers.

Follow us on both HF and Git to stay updated as we continue releasing more high-quality datasets in the near future. Some datasets maybe only uploaded on HF.

Due to the dataset's large size, we are unable to upload it directly to Github. Please download it here:
